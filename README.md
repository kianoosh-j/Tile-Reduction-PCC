This project contains my Tile Reduction algorithm, which improvs running time of Pearson Correlation Coefficent. I further provided a typical implementation
of correlation coefficient on GPU so that you can compare them together. The demo code is generated by random data, but it originally was created for my 
Correlation Power Analysis project, which is available on my github.
